## Notes

I was very nervous to start this project since my experience with React was of almost 4 years ago. I had a few challenges around getting data and component logic to line up. Debugging took the most amount of time like React having creator.name while supabase creator.Name. I had to remind myself often that I had to keep going. It gave me a great boost of confidence to complete.
